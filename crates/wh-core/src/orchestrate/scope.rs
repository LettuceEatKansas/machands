//! `scope=`: OBS-style window capture (2026-10-08). While a call is scoped, the "display" the model
//! sees is one window's client area, so the whole screenshot budget (`shot_long`) goes to that window
//! and every coordinate (pixels or 0 to 1000) is relative to it. Port of `computer._SCOPE`,
//! `_capture_rect`, `_scope_now`, `_scope_name`, `_in_view`, `_covered`, `set_scope`, `_step_scope`,
//! `_image_tag` and the `_SCREENLESS` rule of `run_many`.
//!
//! The capture is a crop of the screen, not a read of the window's own surface, so a covered window is
//! raised first (a minimised one restored, or an error). Reading a covered window without raising it
//! is a later improvement through the OS's own window capture.
//!
//! The scope lives in the call's [`super::CallOpts`] behind a shared cell, so it is per call (a new
//! call starts unscoped, nothing leaks to the next caller), the context a recipe step narrows is the
//! same scope, and a step's own `scope` can be put back after the step.
