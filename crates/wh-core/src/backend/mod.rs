//! The platform boundary. One [`Backend`] trait, one implementation per OS (`wh-win`, `wh-mac`) and
//! an in-memory [`fake::FakeBackend`] for the core's own tests. Everything above the trait is
//! platform-agnostic.
//!
//! The trait was derived from the Python build's actual platform surface: every function in
//! `core.py`, `computer.py`, `fast.py`, `caller.py` and `daemon.py` that touches Win32, UI
//! Automation, OCR, capture, input, the clipboard or the process table. Each method's doc comment
//! names the Python function(s) it replaces as `file.py:function`.
//!
//! Design rules:
//!
//! * No OS type crosses the boundary (see [`types`]). Windows and elements are opaque handles.
//! * A backend does the OS call and nothing else. Policy lives in the core: which window an action
//!   may touch, destructive-command refusals, the caller guard, settle timing, retries.
//! * Methods take `&self` and the trait is `Send + Sync`; the daemon serves each call on its own
//!   thread. A backend initialises per-thread OS state (COM on Windows) lazily.
//! * Time budgets are explicit [`Duration`] arguments, so a hung app can never
//!   stall a call longer than the caller allows.
//! * Input methods take an [`InputGuard`], the Python `guard=` callback: run before every injected
//!   event, and an `Err` stops the rest. Pass [`no_guard`] when there is nothing to re-check.
